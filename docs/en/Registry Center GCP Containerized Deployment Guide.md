# Registry Center - Google Cloud Platform Containerized Deployment Guide

This guide walks you through deploying the Registry Center service to Google Cloud Platform **step by step** — no technical background required.

---

## Prerequisites

You need a **Google Cloud account** (sign up with Gmail) with a **GCP project** that has billing enabled.

> New users get $300 in free credits. Running this service costs approximately $1–2 per day with the minimum configuration (~$0.06/hour).

### How to Create a GCP Project (If You Don't Have One)

1. Open your browser and go to https://console.cloud.google.com
2. Sign in with your Gmail account
3. At the top, click **"Select Project"** → **"New Project"**
4. Enter any project name (e.g., `openan-proj`) and click **"Create"**
5. After creation, go to **"Billing"** in the left menu → link a billing account (requires a credit card or PayPal)
6. **Note down your Project ID** (GCP appends a number to your project name, format: `openan-proj-123456`)

## Deployment Steps (Only 3 Steps)

### Step 1: Install gcloud CLI

Open PowerShell (right-click Start → "Windows PowerShell" or "Terminal") and paste the following command:

```powershell
(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe", "$env:TEMP\gcloud-installer.exe"); Start-Process "$env:TEMP\gcloud-installer.exe" -Wait
```

During installation:
- Keep all default options, click **Next** through everything
- **Check** the option "Start shell after installation" or "Run gcloud init"
- If a command line window prompts you to sign in, use your Gmail account and select the project you created

> After installation, **close your current PowerShell window and open a new one**.

---

### Step 2: Verify Login Status

In the new PowerShell window, run:

```powershell
gcloud auth list
```

If your Gmail account appears, you're logged in.

If not, run `gcloud auth login` — a browser window will open for you to sign in.

---

### Step 3: Navigate to the Project Directory and Deploy

```powershell
cd <project-directory-path>
.\deploy-all.ps1
```

> Replace `<project-directory-path>` with the actual path to the `registry-center` folder. For example:
> ```powershell
> cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\registry-center
> ```

You will be prompted to enter:
1. **GCP Project ID** — the ID you noted down when creating your project
2. **Database Password** — set any password, or press Enter to auto-generate one

The script will then automatically:
- ✓ Create a Cloud SQL PostgreSQL database
- ✓ Build the Docker image
- ✓ Deploy to Cloud Run

**Note**: If this is not your first deployment, you may see `ALREADY_EXISTS` errors during Step 4. This is normal — no action is needed.

**The entire process takes approximately 10–15 minutes**. Once you see `DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL!`, you're done.

## Verifying the Deployment

The script outputs a `https://xxxxx.run.app` URL at the end — this is your service URL.

Open `https://xxxxx.run.app/rest/v1/registry-center/agent-cards` in your browser. If you see `{"agentCards":[]}`, the service is running normally (an empty list means no agents have been registered yet).

Alternatively, test with PowerShell:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://xxxxx.run.app/rest/v1/registry-center/agent-cards"
```

---

## API Endpoints

Once deployed, you can manage Agent Cards through the following endpoints:

| Method   | Path                                                    | Description         |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| `POST`   | `/rest/v1/registry-center/agent-cards`                  | Register an Agent   |
| `GET`    | `/rest/v1/registry-center/agent-cards`                  | Query Agents        |
| `GET`    | `/rest/v1/registry-center/agent-cards/{org}/{name}`     | Get a single Agent  |
| `PUT`    | `/rest/v1/registry-center/agent-cards/{org}/{name}`     | Update an Agent     |
| `DELETE` | `/rest/v1/registry-center/agent-cards/{org}/{name}`     | Deregister an Agent |

Example (registering an Agent):

```powershell
$body = @{
    name = "my-agent"
    description = "A test agent"
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://xxxxx.run.app/rest/v1/registry-center/agent-cards" -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

## FAQ

**Q: I see "gcloud not found" error?**

Close PowerShell and reopen it. If it still doesn't work, gcloud isn't installed properly — go back to Step 1.

**Q: I see "API has not been used" error?**

Wait 1–2 minutes and run `.\deploy-all.ps1` again. Some APIs take time to activate.

**Q: The deployment failed. How do I retry?**

Simply run `.\deploy-all.ps1` again. Already-created resources will be automatically skipped.

**Q: How do I update the service?**

After making code changes, run `.\deploy-all.ps1` again to update.

**Q: How do I shut down the service (to save costs)?**

```powershell
gcloud run services delete registry-center --region=asia-east1
gcloud sql instances delete registry-center-db
```

**Q: What is the estimated cost?**

- **Cloud Run**: No cost when idle. Pay per request.
- **Cloud SQL (db-f1-micro)**: Approximately $0.015/hour.

To save costs, delete the Cloud SQL instance when not in use. Back up your data beforehand if needed.
